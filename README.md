# QuizStar
A way of making education a social experience!
With QuizStar, you can create a user profile, create custom quizzes of any size, save them and edit them later, share your quizzes, and take other users' quizzes.



## Installation & Basic Use
QuizStar can be downloaded from https://www.github.com/VitaRox/QuizStar
From the home screen, users log in by entering a username and password, or create a new account by entering a username, email, and password.  Once logged in, users can create quizzes, delete quizzes, or edit/update quizzes they have made.  They can also play the quizzes of other users.  Navigation is handled by a simple top navigation bar, attractive particularly for a desktop or laptop experience.
